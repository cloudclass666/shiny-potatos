Give your bbPress forum users the ability to report inappropriate content or spam in topics or replies.

== Description ==

Give your bbPress forum users the ability to report inappropriate content or spam in topics or replies. This plugin adds a "report" admin link to topics and replies, when clicked, the topic/reply is assigned a post status of "User Reported".

All logged-in users can report content and see that a topic has been reported, only Moderators and up can un-report the content. Integrates with the standard Topic admin screens.

When a topic is reported, a banner is shown at the top of the page indicating that the topic has been reported as inappropriate. For replies, a message is added within the reply, before the content.

Requires bbPress 2.4+.
