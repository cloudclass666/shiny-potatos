## How it Works?

Flying Pages injects a tiny JavaScript code (1KB gzipped), waits until the browser becomes idle. Then it detects pages in the viewport and on mouse hover and preloads them.

Flying Pages is intelligent to make sure preloading doesn't crash your server or make it slow.

- **Preload pages in the viewport** - Detect links within the viewport (current viewing area) using 'Intersection Observer' and tells the browser to preload them using 'prefetch', switch to xhr if not available (similar to [Quicklink](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/quicklink)).

- **Preload pages on mouse hover** - On hovering links, if it's not preloaded yet using above 'viewport', then Flying Pages will prefetch them instantly (similar to [Instant.page](https://instant.page/)).

- **Limits the number of preloads per second** - If your page has too many links, prefetching all at the same time will cause the server to crash or slow down the website to visitors. Flying Pages limits the number of preloads per second (3 req/sec by default) using an in-built queue. For example, if you've 10 links in the viewport, preloading all these are span into 4 seconds.

- **Stops preloading if the server is busy** - In case the server starts to respond slowly or return errors, preloading will be stopped to reduce the server load.

- **Understands user's connection and preferences** - Checks if the user is on a slow connection like 2G or has enabled data-saver. Flying Pages won't preload anything in this case.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= My GTmetrix fully load time increased after installing Flying Pages. What to do? =
Flying Pages starts preloading when all other resources have completed downloading and browser has become idle. It will not affect the TTFB or First Contentful Paint or Time to Interactive. If you’re worried about the fully loaded time in GTmetrix, set the "Delay to start preloading" to a higher number in settings or set it to preload only on mouse hover.

= How to check if Flying Pages is working or not? =
See the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T658UlOKdx8) and you'll find 'prefetch cache' (test it from an incognito window if you've enabled 'Disable for logged in admins')

= I’m not seeing any improvements in GTmetrix/Pingdom/Google PageSpeed Insights =
Flying Pages preload links after the website is loaded and only improves the speed on clicking links. It doesn’t help you to speed up the initial load.

= Do I need a cache plugin? =
Every time a page/link is preloaded, it executes some PHP code and MySQL queries which is resource-intensive. So it's highly recommended to use a cache plugin like [WP Rocket](https://wpspeedmatters.com/get/wp-rocket).

= Recommended hosting provider & cache plugin? =
Flying Pages works with every hosting provider, without any cache plugins. However, to get the best results, consistent performance and no downtime, our recommended hosting provider is [Cloudways](https://wpspeedmatters.com/get/cloudways) and cache plugin [WP Rocket](https://wpspeedmatters.com/get/wp-rocket).

= Do Flying Pages affect Google Analytics or similar tracking scripts? =
Flying Pages only downloads the HTML content. It doesn't execute any code inside it. So it will not affect Google Analytics or similar scripts.

= Will Flying Pages increase my bandwidth usage? =
It's mostly videos and images that consume 80% of the bandwidth. Flying Pages only preloads HTML pages (which is usually <30KB) and doesn't download any resources inside it (like images, css, js). Installing Flying Pages won't increase your bandwidth usage not even by 5%.

= Do Flying Pages increase server load? =
In short, yes. But you can configure Flying Pages to limit the number of preloads per second or preload only on mouse hover which reduces the server load. Also, make sure to use a good hosting provider like [Cloudways](https://wpspeedmatters.com/get/cloudways) and a cache plugin like [WP Rocket](https://wpspeedmatters.com/get/wp-rocket). This will reduce server load dramatically.

= How to get support? =
