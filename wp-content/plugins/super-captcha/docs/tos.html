<h2 class="title_line">Pornography and Hosting Thereof<a name="pornography"></a></h2>
We do not restrict our clients on the morals of the content they host under their rights to free press and expression so long as this right does not compromise the liberties of another individual. &nbsp;However and to offload the labor and cost to become legally compliant in investigating our client for legal violations, any pornography sites will be accessed extra fees for accounting of that site and verification that all content is legal in accordance with Federal and North Carolina State Laws. This means that each actor or photographic subject must provide proof of age, name, location, and all the information that the US Government would require should our servers be audited in consequence for hosting the site. These fees will accommodate a $165.00 per hour consulting fee for investigating the site, verifying the site, and the issuance of a seal of approval for the display of legal pornography.

Please note that this consultation fee is much higher than normal because of the sensitivity of &#147;harassment&#148; and the display of sexuality in the work place. This requires stricter working habits and environments that we must enforce in-house and in accounting.

All pornography must not mimic, perpetuate, or otherwise display the act of a crime by Federal or North Carolina State Law. Should you need to know what acts of sex are considered to be unlawful please see <a href="http://www.ncleg.net/gascripts/statutes/statutes.asp" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The North Carolina General Assembly</a>‘s website.

<h2 class="title_line">HOSTING FAIR USE CLAUSE<a name="hosting fair use clause"></a></h2>
We offer several services which are described as or may contain attributes that are described and marketed as &#147;Unmetered&#148;. Unmetered does not mean UNLIMITED nor should you assume so. Unmetered means we do not limit your usage so long as it does not impact our servers, services, or other clients in a negative way. You should always be mindful of the items you host on our networks and monitor your usages, especially your CPU usage. Because some services cannot or are not bound to a specific user name (namely MySQL) we limit your usage by the amount of data each table holds or the quantity of tables.

You should never exceed more than 800 tables per MySQL database, nor should you exceed one gigabyte per database. We will start to warn you when you near these performance limits that MySQL has set for their software.Should your site at any time be deemed to be using more than its &#147;fair use&#148; or &#147;fair share&#148;, you will receive a warning email and be given 48 hours to make any necessary adjustments to bring your site back in compliance to this term. Should your site be unable or not willing to comply to the email you receive within a 48 hour time-frame (from the time-stamp on the email) your site will be suspended.

On the data of suspension, an email will be sent offering the client an upgrade to a VPS (Virtual Private Server) or Dedicated Server. These can be both managed and unmanaged.This section is set forth to all clients whom have purchased any variety of hosting plans in which are not managed (all management of files and databases are done by the client).

&nbsp;
<h2 class="title_line">UNSOLICITED TRANSMISSIONS (SPAM)<a name="spam"></a></h2>
(Before we start here, I think we can agree that everyone hates spam, spam is no good, and spam costs everyone money especially the &#147;company&#148; receiving it. Before anyone runs off thinking that asking for a business partnership that is relevant, help for a product purchased, is not even close to considered spam. Spam is the transmittal of a unsolicited email that contains unwanted or unwelcome solicitations for business.)

By using any portion of this website or by sending any transmittal to any GoldsboroWebDevelopment.com domain you hereby agree and understand that all Unsolicited Transmittals cause damage to the recipient and should you, your company, or ISP be found to be harboring, allowing, or transmitting said trasnmittals, each may be billed up to $500.00 or the maximum allowable by law.

We hold entire networks responsible. We do not have the funding nor the manpower to request a subpena for every piece of spam we receive. Therefor if your organization gets a bill for participation in the transmittal of spam, you shall be legally and morally (credit bureau morals) responsible for the full sum of the bill. You may however, choose to pass the bill along to your client or network participant, but if they are unwilling to pay your company will still be reported to the credit bureaus.

Those caught sending spam through Goldsboro Web Development will be accessed a $10.00 Spam Transmittal fee for each INDIVIDUAL PIECE OF SPAM which will be used to solely cover our costs and losses in having to transmit it. Also any costs or charges levied on Goldsboro Web Development will be charged to the user transmitting the spam.

The client therefor acknowledges and agrees that if the client should breech or threaten to breach any of the terms of this agreement, Goldsboro Web Development will sustain irreparable harm and will be entitled to obtain an injunction to stop any breach or threatened breach of this agreement.
