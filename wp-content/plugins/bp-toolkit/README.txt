Block, Suspend, Report for BuddyPress provides enhanced moderation for your BuddyPress site.

== Description ==

Block, Suspend, Report for BuddyPress is a must-have plugin for EVERY BuddyPress installation.

Extra features available in the professional edition.

Each tool is explained further below.

== Block ==

The Block tool allows your members to block another member. They simply click on a 'block' button, either on another member's profile, or on the member list. Once blocked, neither member can send a message to the other. Each member's profile pages become inaccessible, and display a simple message. Neither can view each other's activity updates, or replies, and neither can send a friend request to one another. This is a complete blocking system, no longer limited to private messages and profiles only.

* A simple solution to deal with disputes between members.
* Prevents escalation of abusive or unacceptable conduct between your members.
* Lets your members deal with disputes by themselves, saving you time.

== Suspend ==

The Suspend tool allows you, as an administrator, to suspend a member. Available only to administrators is a 'suspend' button on your member's profiles and the members list. Once clicked by you, all of that member's sessions are terminated, and they will be unable to log back in, instead seeing a custom message explaining the situation.

* Quickly deals with members who have breached your acceptable standards policies.
* Allows you to disable an account - until now, you would have to delete the account, or mark them as a spammer.
* Keeps their profile, uploads, messages and other assets ready, should you decide they can return to the site.

== Report ==

The Report tool has been overhauled for version 2. It allows your members to flag inappropriate, abusive, or otherwise unacceptable behaviour to the site administrator. Each member's profile now incorporates a 'report' button. This creates a new report, which administrators can see in the backend. You can specify a report type, similar to social media networks such as Facebook, to designate that report as 'spam' or 'abusive' and so on. You can set Block, Suspend, Report to email you when a new report is received.

* Gives your members peace of mind that the site is open to moderation.
* Allows you to deal with any report in your own time, without having to respond to internal messages or other notifications.

== Block, Suspend, Report for BuddyPress Pro Edition ==

= The Professional version adds the following features: =

* Premium email support
* Ability to add custom CSS to match your theme's styling perfectly
* Automatically receive new features as they are built
* A 'Latest Reports' box in the dashboard

= Plus, extra features for each tool: =

= Suspend =

* Send a fully customisable email to a suspended user. Handy to give an explanation about why they were suspended and what they can do to rejoin your community.
* Suspend a user from the backend, directly from the Users Table.

= Report =

* You can allow a huge range of content to be reported, not just members themselves:

Activity Updates
Activity Comments
Groups
Private Messages
Forum Topics
Forum Replies
rtMedia Uploads

* Create your own report types, or edit the defaul ones.
* Add your own reports from the backend, ideal for when your members flag content directly to you via a private message or similar.
