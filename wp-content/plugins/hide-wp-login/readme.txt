Protect from brute force attacks renaming wp-login.php 

== Description ==
Hackers regularly target wp-login.php and brute force using a list of usernames and passwords. This makes your WordPress site susceptible to potential hacking attacks and also slows down the website.

This plugin not only renames wp-login.php but adds a passcode or password to the URL. This makes it impossible for a hacker or an attacker to know the location of login url. 

Bonus Feature: It can also redirect /wp-admin for non-logged in users to any url of your choice.
