TODO - Various brainstroming ideas, feel free to build them.
1. Make it use BP-component
2. The widget should extend or override BP groups widget
3. A tab into the user profile ->groups, visible only to login user
4. On/off checkboxes on group suggestion page where login user can select from which user groups he should get suggestions.
5. Add count of friends etc participating in each suggested group.
6. Add feature "Suggest this groups to friends" and "Groups sugggested by friends"
7. Add more apply_filters ex. on group suggestion not found
8. Administration pages for super admin, from which he can:
    - set the last activity date, in order a group to be suggested
    - add suggested groups,
    - exclude groups from suggestion list,
    - view statistics on hidden groups,
    - define featured groups (Other plugin ?)
