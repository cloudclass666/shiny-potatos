WP Ajaxify Comments hooks into your comment form and adds AJAX functionality - no page reloads required when validating, posting or updating comments

== Description ==

When submitting the comment form, WordPress by default reloads the entire page. In the case of an error (e.g. an invalid email address or an empty comment field) the error message is shown on top of a new (blank) screen and the user has to use the browser's back button to correct his inputs before posting the comment again.

The WP Ajaxify Comments WordPress plugin hooks into any WordPress theme and adds AJAX functionality to the comment form: When the user submits his comment, the plugin sends the data to the WordPress backend without reloading the entire page. In the case of an error, the plugin shows an overlay containing the error message so that the user can correct his comment without navigating back. If the comment has been posted successfully, the plugin adds the (new) comment to the list of existing comments without leaving the page and shows an information overlay.

Moreover this plugin includes an option to automatically refresh the comments on the current page while the user stays on your page without requiring a page reload.

**tl;dr**

WP Ajaxify Comments hooks into your theme and improves the usability of the comment form by validating and adding comments without the need of page reloads.

**Technical note**

Since the plugin hooks into the theme on client-side to intercept the comment form submit process, and to add new comments without reloading the page, the plugin needs to access the DOM nodes using jQuery selectors. The plugin comes with default values for these selectors that were successfully tested with WordPress' default themes "Twenty Ten", "Twenty Eleven", "Twenty Twelve", "Twenty Thirteen", "Twenty Fourteen", "Twenty Fifteen", "Twenty Sixteen". If required, the selectors can be customized to match your theme in the plugin's settings.

**Important**

If the plugin does not work out of the box with your theme, custom selectors could be defined in the plugin's settings. If you don't succeed in configuring the proper selectors, we'd be happy to support you! Check our <a href="https://weweave.net/s/wp-ajaxify-comments/support">support page</a> for further information on individual assistance. The plugin is highly customizable and *We're aware of only a few conflicts with any themes or other plugins that cannot be resolved* (see "Known incompatibilities" in the FAQ section).
